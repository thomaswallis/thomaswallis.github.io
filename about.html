                                    <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="1.4s">hi! my name is thomas but i usually go by tom. i’m a 21 year old software developer turned into a project manager. i’ve always wanted to become a project manager in a tech related company as that is something that works really well for my personality as i really enjoy being able to work on a project and have interactions at every step along the way and i really love tech. i decided that i wanted to be a software developer first and go down that road so as to develop a greater understanding around how projects work from that end so that i wouldn’t just be another project manager who doesnt understand how the tech actually works as ive had to work under those types of people and it really isn’t fun, making a backend change and then having them ask why they cant see any change. i have also worked as a tech support agent so as to develop the expertise of being able to talk to people from all levels of technical knowledge to explain a topic or situation.</p>
                                    <br></br>
                                    <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="1.6s">why project management? well coming at it from a logical sense its one job that will never go away as there will always be work and there will always be projects to manage. i’m also a very big people person and love to talk and work with new people as it allows you to learn so much quicker than if you were just with the same people in the same team for years. furthermore, i have been dipping my toes into working as a project manager since i started working as i would be the lead developer and be the main point of contact for the client where i would talk with them and let them know time frames, go through what their requirements were and also how necessary it was to build anything they asked for. i liked to question the client to figure out why they wanted a piece of functionality so that i could better understand their needs and potentially come up with a better way of achieving their goal. </p>
                                    <br></br>                           
                                    <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="1.6s">why norway? so, i have been coming to norway for around 3-4 years as of 2020 due to having a girlfriend from there,  and since meeting her for the first time in norway i have been head over heels in love with the culture there and the people, i fell in love with the fjords, the mountains, the forrests, the work culture, the lifetyle. ever since then i have been learning the language and looking at ways in which i can actually get myself to norway.</p>
